Experience
----------

Since December 2013
    Research Fellow for Reproductive Endocrine Unit, Massacusetts
    General Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts).

    Investigating the genetic basis of reproductive endocrine disorders
    using whole exome and genome sequencing

January 2009 - October 2013
    PhD in Bioinformatics with Gabor T. Marth (Boston College Chestnut
    Hill, Massachusetts).

    Utilized existing and wrote novel software to analye data from
    population scale and family based whole genome and whole exome
    re-sequencing studies to characterize the contribution of rare
    variants to human genetic diversity and disease risk.

August 2005 - December 2008
    Bioinformatics Programmer Cornell University (Ithaca, NY).

    Implemented bioinformatic data analysis pipelines for DNA
    re-sequencing and genotyping datasets for research projects in
    population and evolutionary genomics which helped facilitate the
    publication of over 10 papers in leading scientific journals.

February 2001 - July 2002
    Bioinformatics Programmer at Stanford University (Stanford, CA).

    Implemented informatics pipeline for sequencing and genotyping of
    candidate genes involved in complex diseases.
