Experience
----------

Since July 2014
:   *Genetics Research Scientist Good Start Genetics* Cambridge,
    Massachusetts

    -   Performing bioinformatic and population genetic analyses on
        Ilumina sequencing data sets on tens of thousands of samples

    -   Evaluate and recommend software for improvements of
        bioinformatics pipeline using latest methods state-of-the-art
        methods

    -   Provide expertise in bioinformatic interpretation of reportable
        variants for clinical laboratory directors

December 2013 - July 2014
:   *Research Fellow for Reproductive Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts
    General Hospital* Boston, Massachusetts

    -   Analyzed whole exome sequencing datasets to investigate the
        genetic basis of reproductive endocrine disorders

    -   Applied bioinformatic and statistical genomics methods to
        prioritize potential pathogenic alleles

    -   Worked in an interdisciplinary group of physicians, genetic
        counselors, and basic scientists

January 2009 - October 2013
:   *PhD in Bioinformatics with Gabor T. Marth* Boston College Chestnut
    Hill, Massachusetts

    -   Utilized existing and wrote novel software to analyze data from
        population scale and family based whole genome and whole exome
        re-sequencing studies to characterize the contribution of rare
        variants

    -   Analyzed capture sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Pilot
        Project

    -   Identified a potential causal mutation in a Mendelian form of
        hearing loss

    -   Demonstrated the applicability of whole-genome amplified DNA in
        capture sequencing

    -   Implemented pedigree aware variant calling algorithm using
        graphical models

August 2005 - December 2008
:   *Bioinformatics Programmer Cornell University* Ithaca, New York

    -   Implemented bioinformatic data analysis pipelines for DNA
        re-sequencing and genotyping datasets for research projects in
        population and evolutionary genomics

    -   Contributed to the publication of over 10 papers in leading
        peer-reviewed journals

February 2001 - July 2002
:   *Bioinformatics Programmer at Stanford University* Stanford, CA

    -   Implemented for sequencing and genotyping of candidate genes
        involved in complex diseases
